# RSL

The RSL is the robot safety light, and is used to tell when the robot is on, and when it is enabled. When the robot is on, the light is on, and when it is enabled, the light is flashing. This light should be wired to the [Rio](/Components/RoboRIO), and routed into the RSL slot.

The wires going into the RSL should follow the image above, with black going into N and red going into La with a jumper wire to Lb
