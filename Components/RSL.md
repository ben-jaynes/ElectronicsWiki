# RSL
![frc_status_light.svg](/frc_status_light.svg)
The RSL is the robot safety light, and is used to tell when the robot is on, and when it is enabled. When the robot is on, the light is on, and when it is enabled, the light is flashing. This light should be wired to the [Rio](/Components/RoboRIO), and routed into the RSL slot.
